## Languages & Tools
#### JavaScript (ES6): 
Interactive and dynamic functionalities.
#### HTML5: 
Semantic structure and layout of the web pages.
#### CSS3: 
Modern, responsive, and visually appealing designs.
#### Jest: 
Automated testing to ensure code reliability and quality.


## Features
#### Dynamic Product Display
Products are dynamically rendered based on JSON data or API integration, allowing scalability for product catalogs. Each product displays details such as title, description, price, and images.

### Interactive Shopping Experience
#### Users can:
* Browse and search products.
* Add items to the cart.
* View and edit the shopping cart contents.
* Proceed to checkout with a streamlined process.

#### Category-Based Organization
* Products are categorized for easy navigation.
* Category filters allow users to sort and find products by category, rating or price.
* User-Friendly Design
* Responsive design ensures compatibility across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* Intuitive UI for effortless browsing and shopping.

#### Persistent Cart Data
Shopping cart data is saved using the localStorage API, ensuring users' selections are retained between sessions.


## Automated Testing with Jest
#### Comprehensive unit and integration tests for:
- Cart functionalities (e.g., add, remove, and update items).
- Product rendering and filtering.
- Data persistence via localStorage.

#### Error Handling & Compatibility
Gracefully handles edge cases, such as:
- Empty product lists or cart data.
- API response delays or failures (fallback messages displayed).
- Compatible with modern web browsers.


## Outcome
Bloom provides a flexible, extendable platform for building e-commerce applications. With a focus on modular code and separation of concerns, the project is designed to be maintainable and scalable. Automation testing with Jest ensures high-quality code, while responsive design and localStorage integration offer an excellent user experience.

## Future Enhancements
Integration with a fake backend API for real-time data (using this link: https://fakestoreapi.com/products ).
Advanced filtering and sorting options.
Payment gateway integration for seamless transactions (not functioning now).
